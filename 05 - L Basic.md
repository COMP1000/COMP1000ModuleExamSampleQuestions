## Use a loop to print a right half pyramid pattern of size `n`:

*For example, for `n = 5`, the following pyramid is printed.*

```java
#
##
###
####
#####
```

## Given a size, `n`, write a loop to print a right half pyramid with incrementing digits on each line.

*For example, for `n = 4`, the following pyramid is printed.*

```java
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
```
> Note that the digits on each row are separated by spaces.

## Given a positive integer `n`, use a loop to calculate the factorial of `n`.

For example, when `n = 5`:

## Given two floats  `num` and `n`, use a loop to calculate `num` to the power of `n` and store it in a variable called `result`

> Assume that `n` >= 0 **and** `num` != 0

For example, 
- when `num = 10` and `n = 2`, `result` should be `100`
- when `num = 3` and `n = 3`, `result` should be `27`
- when `num = 20` and `n = 0`, `result` should be `1`

## Write a piece of code that displays the following pattern on the console.

## Use a loop to create the following image:

> Make sure to think about which circles should be drawn first

## Convert the following code to use a while loop instead of a for loop

```processing
for (int i = 0; i < 200; i+=40) {
    fill(0, 0);
    stroke(0);
    circle(width/2, height/2, i);
}
```

## What would be the output of the following code?

```processing
for (int n = 0; n < 10; n += 1)
{
	if (n % 2 == 0)
	{
		print(n * n);
	}
	println(n + 3);
}
```
