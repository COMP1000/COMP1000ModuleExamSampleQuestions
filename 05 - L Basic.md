### Question 1

Use a loop to print a right half pyramid pattern of size `n`:

*For example, for `n = 5`, the following pyramid is printed.*

```java
#
##
###
####
#####
```

### Question 2

Given a size, `n`, write a loop to print a right half pyramid with incrementing digits on each line.


*For example, for `n = 4`, the following pyramid is printed.*

```java
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
```
> Note that the digits on each row are separated by spaces.

### Question 3

Given a positive integer `n`, use a loop to calculate the factorial of `n`.

For example, when `n = 5`:

> $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$
